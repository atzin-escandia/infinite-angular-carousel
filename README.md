An **infinite carousel** built using Angular that allows you to showcase a collection of items in a continuous loop. ðŸŽ‰

## Features :sparkles:

- **Infinite Looping:** Items seamlessly loop back when reaching the end of the carousel, providing a continuous browsing experience.

- **Responsive Design:** The carousel is designed to adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on various devices.

- **Customizable:** Easily configure the carousel's appearance, behavior, and content to suit your needs.
